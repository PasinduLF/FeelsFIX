# FeelsFIX
FeelsFix is an online therapy booking system developed as a final year project at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT). The platform aims to bridge the gap between mental health professionals and clients by providing a centralized digital solution. It addresses the challenges of traditional, manual appointment systems, offering a streamlined approach to managing therapy sessions, payments, and client-therapist communication.

Key Features and Functionality
The system is designed with a multi-role architecture, catering to clients, therapists, and administrators. Its core components include:

•	User Management: A robust system for user registration, authentication, and role-based access control, ensuring secure and personalized user experiences.
•	Appointment Management: Facilitates the scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation of therapy sessions, with automated reminders to minimize no-shows and improve efficiency.
•	Payment Management: A secure module for handling financial transactions, including the generation of invoices and the tracking of payment histories and refunds.
•	Workshop Management: Allows therapists to organize and conduct group therapy sessions, providing a scalable solution for reaching a wider audience.
•	Content and Feedback System: Enables therapists to share valuable wellness content and allows clients to provide feedback and ratings, fostering a community-driven environment and aiding in quality assurance.

Technical Stack and Methodology
FeelsFix was developed using the MERN stack, a popular choice for full-stack web applications. The architecture is composed of:

•	MongoDB: The NoSQL database used for storing all application data.
•	Express.js: The back-end web application framework for building RESTful APIs.
•	React.js: The front-end JavaScript library for building the user interface.
•	Node.js: The JavaScript runtime environment for the back-end.
•	The project adhered to an Agile Software Development methodology, using a component-based design. The development workflow was managed through a GitHub repository with a feature-branching strategy, promoting collaborative and efficient code integration.
